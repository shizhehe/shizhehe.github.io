      title={SOE: SO(3)-Equivariant 3D MRI Encoding}, 
      author={He, Shizhe and Paschali, Magdalini and Ouyang, Jiahong and Masood, Adnan and Chaudhari, Akshay and Adeli, Ehsan},
      abstract="Representation learning has become increasingly important, 
                especially as powerful models have shifted towards learning 
                latent representations before fine-tuning for downstream tasks. 
                This approach is particularly valuable in leveraging the 
                structural information within brain anatomy. However, a common 
                limitation of recent models developed for MRIs is their tendency 
                to ignore or remove geometric information, such as translation 
                and rotation, thereby creating invariance with respect to 
                geometric operations. We contend that incorporating knowledge 
                about these geometric transformations into the model can 
                significantly enhance its ability to learn more detailed 
                anatomical information within brain structures. As a result, we 
                propose a novel method for encoding 3D MRIs that enforces 
                equivariance with respect to all rotations in 3D space, in other 
                words, SO(3)-equivariance (SOE). By explicitly modeling this 
                geometric equivariance in the representation space, we ensure 
                that any rotational operation applied to the input image space 
                is also reflected in the embedding representation space. This 
                approach requires moving beyond traditional representation 
                learning methods, as we need a representation vector space that 
                allows for the application of the same SO(3) operation in that 
                space. To facilitate this, we leverage the concept of vector 
                neurons. The representation space formed by our method captures 
                the brain's structural and anatomical information more 
                effectively. We evaluate SOE pretrained on the structural MRIs 
                of two public data sets with respect to the downstream task of 
                predicting age and diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease from 
                T1-weighted brain scans of the ADNI data set. We demonstrate 
                that our approach not only outperforms other methods but is also 
                robust against various degrees of rotation along different axes.",

               an essential role, and we statistically prove the hypothesis
