  abstract  = "We investigate the problem of domain shift in the context of
               state-of-the-art MRI reconstruction networks with respect to
               variations in training data. We provide visualization tools and
               support our findings with statistical analysis for the networks
               evaluated on the 1.5 T/ 3 T fastMRI knee/neuro data. We observe
               that the signal-to-noise ratio of the examined sequences plays
               an essential role, and we statistically prove the hypothesis
               that both the type and amount of training data are less
               important for low acceleration factors.",
